Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Probably you already have this since most of modern development tools use NPM. When node.js is installed you can run the following command:
``` bash
$ npm install webpack -g
```
This will make the webpack command globally available.

Install the webpack-dev-server (http://webpack.github.io). This enables you to use the webpack-dev-server for any project you want.
``` bash
$ npm install webpack-dev-server -g
```

## Getting it up and running
Now [Webpack] is installed you can fork this repository. Check it out and install dependencies:
``` bash
$ npm install
```

Now all dependencies are installed you can run a dev server:
``` bash
$ webpack-dev-server
```
Now you can view the page at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
